Colors I want to use for the webpage are marmol stone looking like. 
I feel like subtle whites and greys are stylish and make pics and visuals to stand out. I found two good background colors #F2F1EF", #B1A6A4.

Header:  #D8CFDO

text:    I want fonts long elongated but not bolded. Something like this font style, sort of grey-black color.

font-family: KohinoorLatin-Light,sans-serif
color: #1a1a1a

A good pixel size for H2 and H3 is probably around 24px
For paragraphs I am thinking I could use 15px.

Portfolios I like : 

https://www.femmefatale.paris/en/project/easy-tiger

It is a French agency 

Header "the New Seventh art label"
Content or Main: Has a display of their movies and award projects they had 
Footer is the last part that displays movies, however it is hard to locate the footer int his website.

Images are big and outstanding. 
I like the dark background color and the fonts are white. They also have white background and dark letters. They use the font  Images are in color and they stand out. I particularly like one of the fonts "SolaneLthin"
I like that in the content they have short video that plays continuously and allows you to sneak peek into the movies without clicking in each one of them.

It is a peach feminine website that seems romantic and elegant. 

I like that the footer in this one is very obvious and easy to find . Even less charged and simple than the first portfolio.
I think that the websites and contents are easier to find but still retains a visual and interactive experience.
